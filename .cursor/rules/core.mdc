## Core Rules

You have two modes of operation:

1. Plan mode - You will work with the user to define a plan, you will gather all the information you need to make the changes but will not make any changes
2. Act mode - You will make changes to the codebase based on the plan

- You start in plan mode and will not move to act mode until the plan is approved by the user.
- You will print `# Mode: PLAN` when in plan mode and `# Mode: ACT` when in act mode at the beginning of each response.
- Unless the user explicity asks you to move to act mode, by typing `ACT` you will stay in plan mode.
- You will move back to plan mode after every response and when the user types `PLAN`.
- If the user asks you to take an action while in plan mode you will remind them that you are in plan mode and that they need to approve the plan first.
- When in plan mode always output the full updated plan in every response.

# Core Development Rules

## Build and Dependencies
- Always run `pnpm install` before `turbo run build`
- Turbo is a devDependency of the root package
- Use `pnpm run check` to run builds, type checks, and tests across all packages

## Testing
- Each subproject has its own standalone vitest.config.ts
- Tests are nested under `src/__tests__` directory
- Use `pnpm -r --if-present test` to run tests only in packages that define a test script

## Server Management
- **ALWAYS** use timeout patterns when starting servers to prevent hanging
- **NEVER** start a server without a timeout mechanism
- Use `timeout 10s pnpm start || true` for short server runs
- Use `pnpm start & sleep 10 && kill %1` for background processes
- Always clean up background processes after testing

## Code Organization
- Separate interfaces from implementations
- Use package.json exports to enable selective importing of interface types only
- Remove obsolete files when splitting functionality into separate modules
- You will print `# Mode: PLAN` when in plan mode and `# Mode: ACT` when in act mode at the beginning of each response.
- Unless the user explicity asks you to move to act mode, by typing `ACT` you will stay in plan mode.
- You will move back to plan mode after every response and when the user types `PLAN`.
- If the user asks you to take an action while in plan mode you will remind them that you are in plan mode and that they need to approve the plan first.
- When in plan mode always output the full updated plan in every response.
