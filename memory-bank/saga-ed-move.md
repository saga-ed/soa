We recently moved this repository for organization hipponot in github to organization saga-ed.  This effected package naming in a way that I would like you to investigate.  Specifically in nimbee the packages were named (e.g. @hipponot/soa-logger).  The use of the organization @hipponot is a requirement for being able to publish the NPM modules to github.  Can you analyze how the package naming changed and report.

The new code is in ~/dev/soa,  the old repo is in ~/dev/saga-soa.nimbee
