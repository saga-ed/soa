/**
 * derive-instance — the single pure factory for M7 multi-instance ("slots").
 *
 * `deriveInstance({ slot })` maps a numeric slot to an `InstanceProfile`: the
 * complete set of per-slot namespacing knobs (port offset, compose project,
 * state/snapshot dirs, mesh container-name overrides, seed profile, and the
 * generic per-service port-override map). It is the ONE place slot → concrete
 * values is computed; every downstream seam consumes the profile so no call
 * site ever hardcodes a slot-derived value.
 *
 * SLOT MODEL (plan §1): deterministic port-offset `offset = slot * 1000` +
 * project-suffixed namespace `soa-s<slot>`. Slot 0 returns TODAY'S constants
 * verbatim (offset 0, project `soa`, state `/tmp/sds-synthetic`, no snapshot
 * override, no container env) — the byte-identical regression guard: feeding
 * slot-0's `portOverrides`/`meshOffset` through `defaultLaunchContext` yields
 * exactly the no-offset context.
 *
 * PURITY: no docker/make/network IO. The only host-derived read is
 * `os.homedir()` for the per-slot snapshot root (matching `snapshot-store`'s
 * own default) — deterministic per host, no filesystem touch — which the fixed
 * `{ slot }` signature requires. `src/core/**` never imports `src/runtime/**`.
 *
 * SLOT > 0 IS A BACKEND + saga-dash/coach FRONTEND + connect-api SUB-STACK. Slot > 0
 * brings up the backend mesh + services —
 * `iam/programs/scheduling/sessions/content/sis/rtsm/coach-api/ads-adm-api/connect-api`
 * + the mesh — PLUS the `saga-dash` and `coach-web` frontends, which now listen on
 * their OFFSET port (the launch seam appends `--port <base+offset>` to their `pnpm
 * dev`; vite honours the last `--port`, overriding the port baked into the repo dev
 * script / vite config). `connect-api` is now slottable too (soa#271): its one
 * cross-slot literal, `SESSIONS_API_BASE_URL`, is tokenized (`${SESSIONS_PORT}`), so
 * it dials the slot's own sessions-api. What STAYS EXCLUDED (`SLOT_EXCLUDED_SERVICES`):
 * the playback trio (literal postgres/EXPRESS_SERVER_PORT) and `connect-web` — the
 * latter because a real Connect room needs AV (single-node livekit `ws://…:7880`
 * can't be offset), which is slot-0-only. saga-dash/coach frontend→backend edges are
 * `browser` and don't pull the excluded services, so their closures are slottable.
 *
 * The port-override map is derived GENERICALLY over `manifest.services` (never a
 * hand-maintained table), so any future service slots for free. After computing,
 * the factory ASSERTS full-set port disjointness (every service port + the five
 * mesh ports, each + offset) and throws on any collision — guarding a future
 * service whose base could land a multiple of the stride from another.

/**
 * Services EXCLUDED from a slot > 0 bring-up (plan §6 collision matrix). All
 * would CLOBBER or SPLIT-BRAIN onto slot 0:
 *
 *   LITERAL-PORT backends — carry LITERAL ports in their launch env that bypass
 *   the generic `${…_PORT}` / mesh-offset token machinery, so at an offset slot
 *   they would still dial slot 0's ports (postgres :5432, EXPRESS_SERVER_PORT
 *   6301-6303) and silently corrupt / collide with the default stack:
 *     - the playback trio — literal `POSTGRES_PORT '5432'` + `EXPRESS_SERVER_PORT`.
 *
 *   `ads-adm-api` is NO LONGER excluded: its launch env is fully tokenized
 *   (`${ADS_ADM_DB_URL}` / `${SESSIONS_PORT}` / `${IAM_URL}` / `${DASH_URL}`)
 *   and its listen port is env-driven (`portEnvVar: 'EXPRESS_SERVER_PORT'`,
 *   injected by the M13 listen-port seam at offset slots), so it both LISTENS
 *   on and DIALS its own slot's ports.
 *
 *   `connect-api` is NO LONGER excluded either (soa#271): its listen port is
 *   env-driven (`portEnvVar: 'PORT'` ← `${CONNECT_API_PORT}`) and its one cross-slot
 *   dial, `SESSIONS_API_BASE_URL`, is now `${SESSIONS_PORT}`-tokenized, so it both
 *   LISTENS on and DIALS its own slot's ports. Its remaining literals (livekit /
 *   FLEEK `ws://…:7880`) are AV — harmless at an offset slot because AV bring-up is
 *   gated to slot 0 (`startConnectAv` requires `slot === 0`), so connect-api never
 *   opens a slot>0 livekit connection through the stack path.
 *
 *   `connect-web` FRONTEND — stays EXCLUDED. It has a listen-port seam (the launch
 *   layer appends `--port` for any `isFrontend` service at an offset slot) and its
 *   backend `connect-api` is now slottable, but a real Connect room requires AV
 *   (single-node livekit `ws://…:7880` bypasses the offset → slot-0-only). FOLLOW-UP:
 *   make livekit/coturn per-slot (or add an AV-connected-gate test hook), then drop
 *   `connect-web` from this list too.
 *
 * The OTHER two frontends — `saga-dash` and `coach-web` — are NO LONGER excluded:
 * they listen on their offset port via the launch-seam `--port` append, and their
 * backend deps (iam/programs/scheduling/sessions/content/sis, coach-api) all run at
 * slot > 0. Their frontend→backend edges are `browser`, so they don't pull the
 * excluded literal-port services.
 *
 * Consequence: slot > 0 is a backend + saga-dash/coach frontend sub-stack (see the
 * file header). Services are excluded EXPLICITLY (not via transitive drop, which
 * would orphan a dependent). At slot 0 nothing is excluded (the set is empty), so
 * slot 0 is unaffected.
