/**
 * computeClosure — the N-of-M dependency-closure engine (plan §2.3).
 *
 * PURE: zero IO. Given the manifest and a set of requested services, BFS the
 * transitive closure over `dependsOn`, union the services' databases + mesh
 * units, topo-order the services into launch order, and record WHY each
 * pulled-in service is present.
 *
 *   computeClosure(m, ['scheduling-api','sessions-api'])
 *     ⇒ services {iam-api, programs-api, scheduling-api, sessions-api}
 *        databases {iam_local, iam_pii_local, programs, scheduling, sessions}
 *        mesh {postgres, rabbitmq}            // mongo dropped — no connect-api
 *
 * Two manifest-derived rules fall out for free from the union:
 *  - `connect-mongo` (mesh) is reached only via `connect-api.mesh`, so a closure
 *    without connect-api never includes it.
 *  - `connectv3` (db) is reached only via `connect-api.databases`, likewise.
 *
 * Playback (`optional:true`) services — transcripts/insights/chat — are kept
 * ONLY when `opts.withPlayback` is set. Nothing in the graph `dependsOn` them,
 * so this gate is the only thing that admits them, and a requested playback
 * service is dropped (not launched) unless `--with-playback` is passed.
