# @hipponot/trpc-types

Auto-generated TypeScript types for the tRPC API using `@hipponot/trpc-codegen`.

## Usage

This package is automatically generated from the sector-based tRPC API structure. The types are generated by parsing the router files in `../src/sectors/*/trpc/`.

## Scripts

- `pnpm generate` - Generate types from router files
- `pnpm dev` - Watch mode for automatic regeneration
- `pnpm build` - Generate types and build the package

## Generated Files

- `generated/router.ts` - AppRouter type definition
- `generated/schemas/` - Copied Zod schemas from sectors
- `generated/index.ts` - Main exports

All generated files are automatically created by `@hipponot/trpc-codegen` and should not be edited manually.
