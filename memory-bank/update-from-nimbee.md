Please read saga-ed-move.md

The code has been relocated and the package names have been updated to use package.json name has uses the convention `@saga-ed/soa-[name]` where name is a particular app or or package

However there is code that exist in hipponot/saga-soa  branch gh_7032 that I need to bring into the saga-ed repo and convert the incoming code to use the new package naming convention during the merge.

Can you create a plan to effect this merge and update the incoming code to the new package naming scheme
