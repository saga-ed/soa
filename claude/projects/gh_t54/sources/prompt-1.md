The owls teams is working on a POC frontend application on Svelte and SvelteKit

The branches of interest are here and are associated with the ~/dev/coach repo

The soa repo has some next.js based client apps that are largely internal facing but will likely continued to be supported.

I would like to update the plan with a coach/thrive at the app/web level
CLAUDE.md that references the soa/web/docs that describe next.js and
Svelte|SvelteKit dev that the owls and thrive web apps have in common

origin/origin/poc/sveltekit_pages_amplify
origin/poc/sveltekit
origin/poc/sveltekit_pages

I would like to update the plan for the pkg side as well - in this case we want
web api cross for web, node, and runtime agnostic library components again with
CLAUDE.md files associated with these runtimes
